		Dear GoldFinch,
		
	It’s great to finally contact you here! Physical correspondence is nice but quite
	inconvenient and difficult to arrange, what with our secrecy. 
	
	The meeting this week was mentally draining, yet I took solace in your presence.
	Can you believe Dave spent an hour elaborating on his discovery? 
	I kept thinking of your discovery from last year, which was miles more impressive
	than anything Dave has ever done,
	and wanting to mention it. I hope you know that someone sees and appreciates
	you and your hard work for this godforsaken company. 
	
	I can’t believe I’ve never asked your book preferences. I've just finished
	King Lear, a wonderful read and my favorites of Shakespeare’s so far.
	Slowly but surely working through his massive amount of work… starting Hamlet
	tonight, wish me luck!
	Have you ever read Shakespeare? What is your favorite of his? 
	Do you like any other genres? What a rich niche of information I’ve yet to 
	squeeze out of you!
	
	God, there’s so much more i want to say and ask, yet I feel as if this
	message is long enough. 	 
		
	I hope this finds you well and I cannot wait to meet eyes with you again.

	Please respond soon,

	Songbird

		Songbird, 

	Likewise! I don’t feel the need to specify what, as my thoughts seem to
	mirror your own. 
	
	Honestly, I don’t read much in the forms of novels, I prefer stopping
	by the newsstand outside my apartment for a quick hit of
	nonfiction in the morning. It sounds boring, I know, but
	it’s a ritual I’ve grown very fond of.
	
	Did you hear Christine? 
	She came to me yesterday afternoon before leaving the office for the day 
	and asked about you. She said something about <a class= "goldfinch" href="thatwoman's.html">“that woman’s anthology”</a>. I believe
	the one you put together at university? I just wanted to let you know, as 
	I’m unsure why she would even think I would know more about you, we’ve been quiet,
	haven’t we? 

	GoldFinch

		GoldFinch,

	How strange. Can we meet at our usual place on Tuesday to talk this through more?
	
	I don’t think I can say what I want through this keyboard.
